Random post for testing syntax highlighting. Checkout buttons are really cool. Check out this code below for these new buttons. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

```js
// A comment
const name = 'Tom'
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
```

Since this is MDX, we can add the live versions of these buttons too. Shortcuts also show up nicely too: <kbd>Cmd</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>O</kbd>
