I write blog posts in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It
allows me to write and format in plain text so I don't need to take my hands off
the keyboard and fiddle with my mouse.

In theory, I could write, edit, revise, and publish a post without ever looking
at a preview, let alone the generated HTML. Instead, my workflow looks like
this:

1. Write in Vim.
2. Preview in Firefox.
3. Switch back to Vim for revisions.
4. Repeat until done.
5. Add and commit changes, then push to [GitHub](https://github.com/tmm/www).

Vim is probably the wrong tool for the job because it forces me to either
"render" a preview in my head or use a browser. So let's take a quick look at
some other editor types for writing and previewing:

**Split-Pane Editors**, like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io), let you edit
text on one side and view a preview on the other. Clunky! They duplicate content
on the screen and shift your focus away from your cursor. Not much better than
tabbing between a plain text editor and the browser.

**Block-Compiled Editors**, like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/),

**Inline Preview Editors**, like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), add lite
previews as you type: \*emphasis\* becomes _\*emphasis\*_, headings look
heavier, list items maintain their indent across lines, etc. This is better, but
it's redundant to show syntax and preview at the same time. Plus, you need a
preview pane or browser yet again if you want to see the true rendering.

**[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) Editors**, like [Dropbox
Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper), support Markdown on input, but strip
syntax characters once they transform them to their semantic HTML. I know
WYSIWYG is for less technical users and Markdown support is not a primary
feature, but stripping characters seems like a bug.

While all of these have nice features and are decent options, none of them work.
They force you to switch between tools and modes: Writing and previewing are
separate states.

John Gruber sort of captured what

Write, read, revise, all in the same window, all in the same mode.

What I'm about to propose and walk through are some experiments that Markdown
purists probably won't like, but I think make for a seamless writing experience.

Syntax shows up when you need it to, and disappears when you don't.

If youâ€™re well-versed in Markdown editor, you might have noticed I missed one:
Typora.
